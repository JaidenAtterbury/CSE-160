Homework 6

For each problem that requires a written answer, write (or copy-and-paste)
your answers in this file.  When you are done, you should have replaced all
the ellipses (the three dots) with your answers.

Answer to Problem 7:

As calculated in Problem 6, the 2009 Iranian election null hypothesis rejection
p-value is 0.0367. Since the p-value is less than the significance level of
alpha = 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis. Since we rejected the null
hypothesis, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the data from the 2009
Iranian election were fraudulent. In particular, we are 96.33% confident that
the data are fraudulent.

Answer to Problem 8:

As calculated in Problem 8, the 2008 United States election null hypothesis
rejection p-value is 0.4836. Since the p-value is greater than the significance
level of alpha = 0.05 we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Since we have
failed to reject the null hypothesis, there is insufficient evidence to suggest
that the data from the 2008 United States election were fraudulent.

Collaboration:

On Homework 6, I collaborated with no one when writing the code. However,
Tanner Huck and I briefly looked at each others code to make sure we weren't
missing anything/got similar output.
